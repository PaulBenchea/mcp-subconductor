# mcp-subconductor
Subconductor is an MCP server that acts as a Persistent State Machine for AI agents. It prevents "context drift" during long refactors by externalizing the task list into a physical manifest.  It enables non-linear execution, allowing agents to handle dependencies dynamically while maintaining a transparent, resumable audit trail.
